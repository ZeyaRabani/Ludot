# Snakes on a chain

## What is Snakes on a chain

This is a snakes and ladders game instead now.
Snakes on a chain offers a Telegram-based Snakes and Ladders game where winners earn NFTs minted on Polkadot Asset Hub, combining casual gaming with true digital ownership

## Problem: 
Casual games lack real ownership and tangible rewards. Web3 onboarding remains complex for non-crypto users.

## Solution:
A Snakes and Ladders game on Telegram (easy access, no downloads).
Winners receive NFTs minted on Polkadot Asset Hub, stored securely on-chain.
Future plans: Multiplayer modes, betting with DOT, and cross-chain NFT trading.
How Polkadot Achieved This:
Asset Hub’s NFT Pallet enabled low-fee, scalable minting without boilerplate code.
Telegram’s Web App integration simplified onboarding (no wallets needed initially).
XCM (cross-chain messaging) allows future interoperability with DeFi parachains like Acala.
